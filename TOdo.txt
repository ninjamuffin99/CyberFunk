MAIN DEISNG DEICISION:
	IF YOU WANT TO BE MORE STEALTHY YOU NEED TO STAY ON BEAT ALWAYS

get different levels going, so you have a goal for testing


maybe get the hacking segments going?

main menu shit
pause menu shit

different music?
better interaction between the robots and player
dialogue and story shit
tutorial shit
get it so that enemies follow paths
make it so that if they go off path, they return to their routine and shit

some sort of interaction between player and enemy
	sneak up behind them to hack

some doors need specific keys that you steal from enemies

stuff like doors you need to pick lock open and the faster you do it, the more noise you make

you start in darkness

some sort of alert status similar to Metal Gear Solid

you have to keep moving or you get spotted

but how do i make it so that when you move around, it doesnt seem so repetetive?
maybe it forces you to go in different tiles? Like you leave a trail?

get minimap shit going

get a "hackable object" base class going

make it so you can hack into enemies and use them as disguises

the hacking minigame could either be DDR based, or just spam Space, but that'll make more noise and shit
