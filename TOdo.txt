maybe get the hacking segments going?

main menu shit
pause menu shit

different music?
better interaction between the robots and player
dialogue and story shit
tutorial shit
make it so that if they go off path, they return to their routine and shit

stuff like doors you need to pick lock open and the faster you do it, the more noise you make

some sort of alert status similar to Metal Gear Solid

make it so you can hack into enemies and use them as disguises
