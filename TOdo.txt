maybe get the hacking segments going?

main menu shit
pause menu shit

different music?
better interaction between the robots and player
dialogue and story shit

some doors need specific keys that you steal from enemies

stuff like doors you need to pick lock open and the faster you do it, the more noise you make

you start in darkness

some sort of alert status similar to Metal Gear Solid

you have to keep moving or you get spotted

but how do i make it so that when you move around, it doesnt seem so repetetive?
maybe it forces you to go in different tiles? Like you leave a trail?

get minimap shit going

make it so you can hack into enemies and use them as disguises
